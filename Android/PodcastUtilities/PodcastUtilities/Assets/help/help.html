<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>PodcastUtilities is an RSS feed media cache management application. You can</p>
<p>
&#149; Download new episodes from a group of feeds<br>
&#149; Remove old episodes from the cache<br>
&#149; Generate playlists from episodes in the cache<br>
&#149; Use it in conjunction with the desktop version<br>
</p>
<p>Note that it can only perform cache management - PodcastUtilities cannot play media you will need a separate player.</p>
<h3>Why sideload?</h3>
<p>To install PodcastUtilities get the APK from the <a href="https://github.com/derekwilson/PodcastUtilities/tree/feature/android-client/Android/Support/_PreBuiltPackages">_PreBuiltPackages</a> folder on Github. We did attempt to distribute it via the Google Play Store however as we needed "Manage Storage" permission Google declined saying "The feature you identified that is dependent on this permission does not appear to be critical to the core functionality of your app", rather than arguing the toss with a Google-bot we decided to sideload the APK.</p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>PodcastUtilities is configured and controlled by a control file. Its probably easiest if you tweak the control file to your liking using the <a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/podcastutilities-core">desktop version</a> in conjunction with the <a href="https://github.com/derekwilson/PodcastUtilities/tree/master/Documents/User">documentation.</a>.</p>
<p>When you move the XML control file across to your phone (probably email it to yourself) there are some elements you should take care of</p>
<p><b>sourceRoot</b> should be set to the root of your cache on the phone, probably <font face='serif-monospace'><b>/sdcard/Podcasts</b></font></p>
<p><b>playlistPathSeparator</b> should probably be<font face='serif-monospace'><b>/</b></font></p>
<p>Do remember that when you load the control file into this app then the app takes a copy of the control file, if you make any further edits to the file you will need to load it again.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Generally the usage pattern is</p>
<p>
&#149; Purge Podcasts - to get rid of old media<br>
&#149; Download Podcasts - to get new media<br>
&#149; Generate Playlist - to get a playlist of the downloaded media<br>
</p>
<p>You could elect to delete the media files manually and skip the purge, also if you use a folder player for your media then you may not need a playlist.</p>
<h3>Using with the desktop version</h3>
<p>If you use the desktop version (DownloadPodcasts and SyncPodcasts) to manage the cache on your phone and you want to use this app in addition to that mechanism then it should work fine, there are some considerations</p>
<p>
    &#149; Marke sure you use the same naming style on both platforms or the filenames will not match and you might end up with duplicates<br>
    &#149; Try to ensure you use the same version of <font face='serif-monospace'><b>PodcastUtilities.Common.DLL</b></font> on both platforms or the filenames might differ because of differences in the code.<br>
