<h3>PodcastUtilities Cache Manager</h3>
<p>PodcastUtilities is an RSS feed media cache management application. You can</p>
<p>
    &#149; Download new episodes from a group of feeds<br>
    &#149; Remove old episodes from the cache<br>
    &#149; Generate playlists from episodes in the cache<br>
    &#149; Use it in conjunction with the desktop version<br>
</p>
<p>Note that it can only perform cache management - PodcastUtilities cannot play media you will need a separate player.</p>
<h3>Configuring the downloads</h3>
<p>The PodcastUtilities engine <font face='serif-monospace'><b>PodcastUtilities.Common.DLL</b></font> is configured and controlled by an XML control file. There are two mechanisms for changing the configuration</p>
<p>
    &#149; Edit the XML control file directly, usually on a destop computer<br>
    &#149; Modify the configuration in this app<br>
</p>
<p>You can use both mechanisms interchangeably</p>
<h3>Editing the XML control file directly</h3>
<p>You can tweak the control file to your liking using the <a href="https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/podcastutilities-core">desktop version</a> in conjunction with the <a href="https://github.com/derekwilson/PodcastUtilities/tree/master/Documents/User">documentation.</a>.</p>
<p>When you move the XML control file across to your phone (possibly email it to yourself) there are some elements you should take care of</p>
<p><b>sourceRoot</b> should be set to the root of your cache on the phone, probably <font face='serif-monospace'><b>/storage/emulated/0/Podcasts</b></font></p>
<p><b>playlistPathSeparator</b> should probably be<font face='serif-monospace'><b>/</b></font></p>
<p>Do remember that when you load the control file into this app then the app takes a copy of the control file, if you make any further edits to the file you will need to load it again.</p>
<p>Generally the usage pattern is to share your existing control file, via email or the file system, edit the XML and then load the control file back in.</p>
<h3>Configuring within the application</h3>
<p>The configuration screens are a work-in-progress, also they do not give access to every item in the control file.</p>
<h3>The Cache Root</h3>
<p>For a phone its probably easiest to use <font face='serif-monospace'><b>/storage/emulated/0/Podcasts</b></font>.</p>
<p>If you are using Windows Subsystem for Android and want to use the shared Windows File System then you will need to change your SourceRoot to be something like <font face='serif-monospace'><b>/storage/emulated/0/Windows/Podcasts</b></font></p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To add new podcast feeds to the configuration follow these steps</p>
<p>
    &#149; <b>Configure</b> - Select Configure from the main screen<br>
    &#149; <b>Cache Root</b> - Set the cache root to suite you, ensure the global values and feed defaults are set how you want them<br>
    &#149; <b>Add a new Podcast</b> - Select + to add a new podcast feed, give it a name, the name must be unique<br>
    &#149; <b>Add feed RSS URL</b> - Select the new feed and enter a valid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS feed</a><br>
    &#149; <b>Configure Podcast</b> - Override any of the feed defaults for this specific feed<br>
</p>
<p>Podcast utilities uses RSS feeds to access podcast episodes. Podcast sites provide links to podcasts and often these links only work with their own app, you need to look for something called <b>RSS</b>, sometimes the following icon is used</p>

<h3>Downloading episodes</h3>
<p>Generally the usage pattern is</p>
<p>
    &#149; <b>Purge Podcasts</b> - to get rid of old media<br>
    &#149; <b>Download Podcasts</b> - to get new media<br>
    &#149; <b>Generate Playlist</b> - to get a playlist of the downloaded media<br>
</p>
<p>You could elect to delete the media files manually and skip the purge, also if you use a folder player for your media then you may not need a playlist.</p>
<h3>Keyboard</h3>
<p>If a keyboard is present, then the following keyboard shorcuts are available on the main screen</p>
<p>
    &#149; P - Purge Podcasts<br>
    &#149; D - Download from all Feeds<br>
    &#149; G - Generate Playlist<br>
    &#149; S - Settings<br>
    &#149; C - Configure<br>
</p>
<p>You can also use the ESCAPE key as the back button.</p>
<h3>Using with the desktop version</h3>
<p>If you use the desktop version (DownloadPodcasts and SyncPodcasts) to manage the cache on your phone and you want to use this app in addition to that mechanism then it should work fine, there are some considerations</p>
<p>
    &#149; Marke sure you use the same naming style on both platforms or the filenames will not match and you might end up with duplicates<br>
    &#149; Try to ensure you use the same version of <font face='serif-monospace'><b>PodcastUtilities.Common.DLL</b></font> on both platforms or the filenames might differ because of differences in the code.<br>
</p>
<h3>Not on Google Play?</h3>
<p>To install PodcastUtilities you can get the APK from the <a href="https://github.com/derekwilson/PodcastUtilities/tree/master/Android/Support/_PreBuiltPackages">_PreBuiltPackages</a> folder on Github. We did attempt to distribute it via the Google Play Store however as we needed "Manage Storage" permission Google declined saying "The feature you identified that is dependent on this permission does not appear to be critical to the core functionality of your app", rather than arguing the toss with a Google-bot we decided to not list the app there.</p>
<p>You can install <a href="https://derekwilson.net/static/obtainium.html">any of my apps</a> using Obtainium without an app store.</p>
<h3>Source code</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/derekwilson/PodcastUtilities">source code</a> for PodcastUtilities is available on Github.</p>
